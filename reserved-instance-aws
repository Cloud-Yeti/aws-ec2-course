Let's explain "Reserved Instances" in AWS in a simple way:

Imagine you have a favorite toy that you love to play with every day.
You know you'll keep playing with it for a long time because you really like it.

Now, instead of just borrowing that toy from someone every day, you decide to make a special deal.
You tell them, "Hey, I'll use this toy every day for a whole year, so can I pay you for it in advance?" 
They agree, and you pay them upfront.

Reserved Instances in AWS are a bit like that deal for your favorite toy.
When people and businesses use computers and servers in the cloud (like Amazon's cloud,
called AWS), they often know they'll need them for a long time, like a year or even more.
Instead of paying for those computers every single day, they can make a special deal with AWS and pay upfront
for a whole year or more. This way, they save a lot of money because AWS gives
them a big discount for making that commitment.

So, Reserved Instances are like a smart way for people and businesses to use computers in the cloud.
They pay upfront and get a discount because they know they'll be using those computers for a long time,
just like how you made a special deal for your favorite toy.
