Let's explain "Launch Templates" in AWS in a simple way:

Imagine you're a chef, and you often make different types of sandwiches.
Each sandwich needs specific ingredients and instructions.
Instead of writing down the recipe and gathering ingredients every time, you create a special template.
This template has all the details for making a sandwich – what bread to use, what fillings to add, and how to assemble it.

In AWS (a big computer place on the internet), people need to create virtual computers
(called instances) for different purposes, like running websites or apps.
Just like your sandwich recipes, they need specific instructions and settings every time they create an instance.

That's where "Launch Templates" come in. AWS Launch Templates are like those sandwich
templates but for creating virtual computers. Instead of setting up an instance from scratch every time,
users can create a Launch Template that has all the instructions, settings, and configurations they need.

So, when they want to create a new virtual computer (instance), they just use their Launch Template.
It's like following a recipe to make a sandwich – they don't have to remember all the details;
they just use the template, and AWS creates the instance with everything ready.

In summary, AWS Launch Templates are like ready-to-use recipes for creating virtual computers,
making it easier and faster to set up and run different kinds of computer tasks on AWS.
