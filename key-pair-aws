In AWS, a key pair is a secure way to connect and access your instances.
When you create an instance, you specify a key pair that consists of a public key and a private key.
The public key is stored on the instance and is used to encrypt data, 
while the private key is used to decrypt data when you access the instance.

In AWS, a key pair is a secure way to connect and access your instances. When you create an instance, 
you specify a key pair that consists of a public key and a private key. 
The public key is stored on the instance and is used to encrypt data, 
while the private key is used to decrypt data when you access the instance.

You can create and manage key pairs in AWS using the EC2 console, 
AWS CLI or SDKs. You can also use third-party tools to generate key pairs and then upload the public key to AWS.

Key pairs are essential in securing your instances, as they allow only
authorized users to access your instances. Without the private key, no one can access your instances.
It is important to note that you should always keep your private key secure and never share it with others.

When you want to communicate with an instance in AWS that has a key pair associated with it, 
you need to use a Secure Shell (SSH) communication protocol. SSH is a cryptographic network
protocol that provides a secure way to access network services over an unsecured network. 

In summary, key pairs in AWS are used to establish a secure communication channel between you 
and your instances using the SSH protocol. The secure communication channel
enables you to remotely manage the instance securely, execute commands and transfer files.
