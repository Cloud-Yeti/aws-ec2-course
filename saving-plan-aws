Savings Plans allow you to easily reduce your bill by making a commitment to compute usage 
(e.g. $10/hour) instead of making commitments to specific instance configurations or compute services. 
Amazon Web Services offers two types of Savings Plans - Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans.


# Compute Savings

Plans are a way to save money on using certain Amazon Web Services (AWS), like EC2 instances, Fargate, and Lambda. 
These plans give you more flexibility and can reduce your costs by up to 66%. They apply to all types of instances,
regardless of size, region, or other factors. With Compute Savings Plans,
you can save money and still use the AWS services you need.


# EC2 Instance Savings Plans 

provide the lowest prices, offering savings up to 72% in exchange 
for commitment to usage of individual instance families in a region (e.g. M5 usage in N. Virginia).
This automatically reduces your cost on the selected instance family in that region regardless of AZ, size, OS or tenancy.
EC2 Instance Savings Plans give you the flexibility to change your usage between instances within a family in that region.
