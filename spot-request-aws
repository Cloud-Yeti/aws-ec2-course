Let's explain "Spot Requests" in AWS in a simple way:

Imagine you're at a big ice cream shop, and they have a special deal where 
you can buy ice cream at a lower price, but it's only available if they have extra ice cream left at the end of the day.

So, you ask the ice cream seller, "Hey, if you have extra ice cream at the end of the day,
can I get some at a discount?" They say yes. Now, you don't know exactly when you'll get your ice cream,
but you know you'll get it when there's extra, and it'll be cheaper.

In AWS (which is like a giant computer place on the internet), there are lots of powerful computers available.
Sometimes, AWS has some extra computing power that's not being used by others at the moment. That's where "Spot Requests" come in.

With Spot Requests, you can say to AWS, "When you have extra computing power available,
let me use it, and I'll pay a lower price." AWS agrees, and when they have extra,
they let you use it. It's like getting a good deal on ice cream when there's some left over at the end of the day.

So, Spot Requests in AWS are a way to use their extra computing power at a lower price,
but you might not know exactly when you'll get it. It's a bit like the ice cream deal at the shopâ€”cheaper,
but you have to wait for the extra.
