Explaining "Dedicated Hosts" in AWS to a kid:

Imagine you have a big LEGO playroom with lots of different LEGO sets. 
  You know how sometimes you want to play with one particular set, and you don't want
  anyone else to use it? So, you create a special table just for that set,
  and only you and your closest friends are allowed to play with those LEGOs on that table.

In AWS (that's like a super-duper computer place on the internet),
        there are lots of powerful computers that people can use to run their websites, 
        apps, and games. Sometimes, people have very important and special things they
        want to do on those computers, like running a super-secret project or a very special website.

That's where "Dedicated Hosts" come in. It's a bit like having your own special
        table for your LEGO set. With Dedicated Hosts, AWS gives you a whole
        computer all to yourself. Nobody else is allowed to use it except you. 
        You can run your important things on it, and you have full control.

So, just like how you keep your special LEGO set on your dedicated table, 
        in AWS, Dedicated Hosts let people keep their important computer
        stuff on a computer that's dedicated just for them. 
        It's like having a secret hideout in the big world of computers!

Think of AWS like a big playground with many playground sets (computers).
        Normally, lots of people can play on each set (computer),
        but sometimes, some people need a whole playground set just for themselves.

Dedicated Hosts in AWS are like having your own private playground set.
        It's all yours, and nobody else can use it while you're playing there. 
        This is great when you have really important games to play or special secrets to keep.

So, Dedicated Hosts give you your very own playground set in AWS,
        and you get to use it all by yourself for your important computer stuff.
